## Shaders VIA SOURCE

* You can add it though source code, if you even decide to!

**  
```
var bg:BGSprite = new BGSprite('folder/whateverthehellyourstageis', -600, -200, 0.9, 0.9);
				add(bg);
				bg.active = true;

				var testshader:Shaders.GlitchEffect = new Shaders.GlitchEffect();
				testshader.waveAmplitude = 0.1;
				testshader.waveFrequency = 5;
				testshader.waveSpeed = 2;

				bg.shader = testshader.shader;
				curbg = bg
```
## Better main menu

Adds in some cool stuff

## Camera follow + Redstone-Engine UI

* Adds in a hardcoded camera movement like in bambi's purgatory, and it is disablable whenever you feel like it!

* Unique UI toggalble in the option's menu. This include's not limited to (not sure if you can disable color jsons but whatever):
** Diffrent placement in accuracy, and a total note hit's! (judgement counter enabled as well, confusing with it but whatever)

## Freeplay sections

* Make's it possible to play either mod's the base game for FNF.
